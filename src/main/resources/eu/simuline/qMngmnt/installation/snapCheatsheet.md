# Documentation for snap 

For just managing snap packages, called snaps, there is no PDF cheat sheet, 
but instead up to date [online documentation](https://snapcraft.io/docs/quickstart-tours). 
Note that update is automatically so further install commands are superfluous. 
To support creating snaps, detailed documentation as a [PDF](./SnapManual.pdf) is available.
