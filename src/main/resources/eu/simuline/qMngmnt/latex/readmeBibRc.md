# On Bibliographies and Glossaries in bib-files

In this directory, 
`mvn process-sources` places the globally defined, 
i.e. not project specific files generated by dependencies like 

- `*.bib` files for reference typically `litPublic.bib` and maybe `litPrivate.bib` 
- `*.bib` files containing definitions like `glossary.bib` 
- `.latexmkrc` 

which are thus not under version control. 
In contrast, there may be project specific `*.bib` file also which is then under version conrol. 

Accordingly, the `*.bib` files created by `mvn process-sources` and the `.latexmkrc` file 
are eliminated by `mvn clean`. 

# What is special for the config file `.latexmkrc`

To use `latexmk` locally in a folder, one has to place `.latexmkrc` locally. 
To keep uniformity, those files shall be linked to the abovementioned unique `.latexmkrc`. 

# Recreation 

If a file is added by `mvn process-sources`, 
and is removed by `mvn clean`, nevertheless `vscode` may recreate. 
Don't be surprised.
