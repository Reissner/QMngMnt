@entry{IllCond,
name={ill-conditioned},
description = {A parametrized problem is called ill-conditioned, 
if the solution depends sensitively on the parameters, 
%Numeric definition: 
i.e., if prescribed \gls{accN} of the solution requires high \gls{accN} of a parameter. 
%Pragmatic definition: i.e., if the \gls{accN} with which parameters are given 
%do not allow to determine the solution with the needed \gls{accN}.

name={numerically unstable},
description = {A numeric algorithm to solve a problem is called numerically unstable, 
if its accuracy to solve the problem has impact on the accuracy of the solution 
beyond the \gls{accN} of the parameters. }
