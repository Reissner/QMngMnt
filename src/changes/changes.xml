		<!-- write software for various formats to check links. 
			Most important this is for markdown and for latex, but also for apidocs, maybe html. 
			Alternatively: html only. 
			This presupposes that all, included markdown and latex is converted into html. 
			Additional pdf must have the same links. 
			The advantage of this is, that links can be constructed. 
			So become visible only after processing. 

			One way to avoid own implementations is 
			https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-linkcheck-plugin/index.html
			This is based on doxia and is likely to be supported for quite a while. 
			This is a maven plugin, means only checks within a project are checked. 
			-->
		<!-- TBD: write a texinfo maven plugin or search one -->
		<!-- TBD: Tex-parser: 
	 to be generalized according to documentation in grammar. 
	 Tex-parser: problem with unbalanced $ in verbatim environments. 
	 Maybe better write new one or synchronize with Latexml. 
	 This is needed for analysis. -->

		<!-- TBD: write parser for markdown, 
	maybe extract from markdown renderer -->

		<!-- TBD: Write checker which is able to find unresolved links 
	and also base for application extracting docs with links. -->

		<!-- TBD: https://developer.okta.com/blog/2019/12/20/five-tools-improve-java
	jacoco, pmd, spotbugs, japicmp -->

		<!-- TBD: maybe introduce parent pom -->
		<!-- need a terminology database. 
			suggestion: bib-format. 
			terms: precision, accuracy, tolerance -->
		<!-- for latex documents: imports of packages and definitions. -->


		<!-- TBD: write down how to write a pom. 
	Aims: 
	- platform indepencence, 
	- repeatability 
	- quality support 
	- internationality 
	- all lifecycles without warnings 
	  (this can be weakened due to external problems 
	  or for some span of time after external update causing warnings. ) 
	  
	I think, using maven as such solves a lot of problems already. 
	Using it the right way can solve all. 
	
	How to reach this: 
	- properties: 
	  - <project.build.sourceEncoding>UTF-8</project.build.sourceEncoding>
	    for platform independence 
          - <maven.compiler.source>16</maven.compiler.source>
          - <maven.compiler.target>${maven.compiler.source}</maven.compiler.target>
          - <junit.jupiter.version>5.8.1</junit.jupiter.version>
          - <junit.platform.version>1.8.1</junit.platform.version>
	- plugins only given with versions. 
	  (TBD: how to ensure that not forgotten, how to check that up to date?) 
	- enforcer plugin 
	  Rules: 
	  - requireMavenVersion
	  - requireJavaVersion
	  - dependencyConvergence in the long run. 
	  
	  How to ensure depencency convergence? 
	  How to be supported by vs code? 
	  How to ensure that plugins are up to date? 
	  Mention depencency plugin. 
	  See https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-dependency-mechanism.html
	  
	  maven help plugin 
	  
	  Requirements on tests?

		<!-- Release plan: 
		- upload seems to be quite long. 
		  Maybe two jars: one full with all pdfs and the main jar without: 
			just what is needed to configure maven and also bib-files. 
		- warning about java1.5 which seems strange to me 
		- in `mvn site-deploy` eliminate [WARNING] No issue management URL defined in POM. Links to your issues will not work correctly.
		- check why in many cases release plugin 3.2.0 does not work. 
		- check litPublic.bib and make rules. 
		  Maybe a document checking all would be nice. 
			There seem to be problems with capital. 
			Write down somewhere that urls shall work. 
			Maybe it is test.tex. 
		- agree on a common include file. 
	 -->

	 <!-- Synchronization between vscode and maven. 
	Best would be a plugin extracting everything from pom and transforming into setting. 
	For the moment: just go through the projects and analyze what settings are required. 
	These shall be documented. 
	Of course this must be described in this project. -->

	 <!-- Latex and related: 
		- Require bibliographies written for biblatex and biber which shall be the default. 
		- synchronize literature stored and literature in bibliography. 
		- Require terminology management: l2r or XFPNumber or what else. 
		- Write terms in bib format and use bib2gls for glossaries 
		- require a certain version of the latex plugin (not yet implemented). 
		- require standardized inputs. 
		- require latex plugin support \includeonly command
	 -->

	 <!-- .latexmkrc: shall be moved to the latex plugin, 
		but not before this can be added as a dependency. 
	There is one disadvantage: if the .latexmkrc file changes, 
this requires an update of quality management, which is slow. 
but then it requires even an update of the latex plugin. 
Note also that one has to take care of cyclic dependencies between the two projects. -->

<!-- drop a word on plantuml used in markdown. -->
<!-- markddown: flaw is lack of file inclusion 
  Paradox resolves this https://developer.lightbend.com/docs/paradox/current/index.html 
  I dont consider this optimal, but maybe worth a look. -->
<!-- plantuml can include files 
  (https://forum.plantuml.net/6577/ability-include-blocks-code-from-plantuml-file-into-another) 
which is good in the context of markdown but offers also a chance to use one and the same puml file 
also in latex https://plantuml.com/command-line describes a command line tool. 
Also offers ouput in latex. 
This is based on tikz and needs extension of the latex plugin. -->

<!-- concerning markdown evaluate the following: 
well-ar.plantuml seems not to work for me 
jebbs.plantuml
seems to do highlighting, preview, but via server: security gap 
https://plantuml.com/de/picoweb shows an alternative 
yzane.markdown-pdf  converts to pdf but also to html (png and jpg irrelevant)
Not yet activated. 
yog.yog-plantuml-highlight seems not to work for me
pomdtr.markdown-kroki  with lot of formats, among other mermaid and plantuml
Must be evaluated: https://kroki.io/  kroki!
-->

<!-- search for installer qMngmnt-${project.version}-installer.tgz, 
e.g. in general.md.vm. 
There one can see how bad the idea is to bundle the installation scripts as a tgz file. 
A good alternative would be to turn this into a plugin and to add a goal inj, 
to inject these files, .e.g. in a separate folder. 
Risk: maybe other functionality does not work any more.  -->

<!-- https://cbea.ms/git-commit/ -->

<!-- rework instGCexts.sh: seems to no longer work. -->

<!-- try to eliminate Gittyup messages at startup: 

_IceTransSocketUNIXConnect: Cannot connect to non-local host localhost.localdomain
_IceTransSocketUNIXConnect: Cannot connect to non-local host localhost.localdomain
Qt: Session management error: Could not open network socket

-->

<!-- release notes: include this subject. 
  Some inspiration is given in 
  https://www.productplan.com/learn/release-notes-best-practices/ -->
  <!-- references in particular of manuals and norms are always dated. -->

  <!-- rework on instPip.sh. Details are described there -->

  <!-- rework on instVScode.sh: plantuml: eliminate security risk -->

  <!-- inform yourself on checkin of large files like pdf into git. 
  Gittyup releases a warning. 
  Maybe there are adapted solutions. 
  one may also checkin via a script so that these formats are uncompressed before committing. 
  Here, two problems are mixed: pure size and being binary. -->
