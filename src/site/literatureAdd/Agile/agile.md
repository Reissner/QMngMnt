# Generalities on agile development 

This is nothing but the basic, 
one could also say the essential, 
what is written down 
in the [agile manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/). 

## Manifesto for Agile Software Development

We are uncovering better ways of developing
software by doing it and helping others do it.
Through this work we have come to value:

- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
- Working software over comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- Responding to change over following a plan

That is, while there is value in the items on
the right, we value the items on the left more. 

Personal comments: 
I think, what is written down here 
applies to system development in general, 
but to keep in mind is particularly important in software development, 
because of the tremendous agility/versatility/flexibility of software. 

I think the items on the right-hand side 
are no values in their own right, 
rather than a means to reach a value, 
which is partially what is on the left side: 

- Tools are helpers to support to follow a process, 
  but a process is just to streamline 
  interactions between individuals. 
  This is the primary. 
- Comprehensive documentation has two aspects: 
  External documentation for the user of the software 
  writes down the properties which are usable. 
  All other features are not part of the contract, 
  and are not guaranteed; they may change. 
  But of course, the primary is the software. 
- The primary is the satisfaction of the customer(s). 
  But to reach this, one has to know needs and notions, even (s)he is not aware about. 
  To find out, interaction is a means, and at the end, 
  the results must be fixed in a contract, 
  because it is likely, that he changes mind without notifying. 
  Note that also a contract may change. 
  The importance is not that all is static, but that it is documented. 
- Responsiveness is the word for it. 
  Developer and customer, both learn what to develop during development. 
  There must be flexibility to change between working out a plan and following a plan. 

## Principles behind the Agile Manifesto

We follow these principles:

- Our highest priority is to **satisfy the customer** 
  through early and **continuous delivery** of valuable software.

- Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. 
  Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.

- Deliver working software frequently, 
  from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, 
  with a preference to the shorter timescale.

- Business people and developers 
  must work together daily throughout the project.

- Build projects around motivated individuals. 
  Give them the environment and support they need, 
  and trust them to get the job done.

- The most efficient and effective method 
  of conveying information to and within a development team 
  is **face-to-face conversation**.

- **Working software** is the primary measure of progress.

- Agile processes promote sustainable development. 
  The sponsors, developers, and users should be able 
  to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.

- Continuous attention to technical excellence 
  and good design enhances agility.

- Simplicity--the art of **maximizing the amount of work not done**--is essential.

- The best architectures, requirements, and designs 
  emerge from **self-organizing teams**.

- At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, 
  then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.
