# Generalities 

This project

- provides general principles of quality 
  and derives processes and decisions on tools realizing these principles 
  to a wide extent. 
  This is something to [read](./principlesRealize.html).
- provides a specification on [installation](./installation.html), what to install and how to do. 
- serves as a dependency in maven projects 
  providing [resources](./resourcesInjection.html) to configure quality checkers 
  and other resources for documentation, like bibliographies and glossaries, improving quality more indirectly.
