# Generalities 

This project

- provides general principles of quality 
    and derives processes and decisions on tools realizing these principles 
    to a wide extent. 
- provides a file 
    [qMngmnt-${project.version}-installer.tgz](http://www.simuline.eu/RepositoryMaven/eu/simuline/qMngmnt/${project.version}/qMngmnt-${project.version}-installer.tgz)
    for script based installation **but only for final revisions**. 
    For snapshot revisions the user must choose from 
    [folder](http://www.simuline.eu/RepositoryMaven/eu/simuline/qMngmnt/${project.version}/). 
    <!-- not very professional, but a suggestion to improve was added to changes.xml. -->
- serves as a dependency in maven projects 
    providing resources to configure quality checkers 
    and other resources ensuring quality, like bibliographies and glossaries.
